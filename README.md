# In-Progress work on MBED TLS power analysis attack

This repo now contains two looks at MBED-TLS power analysis:

1. In the "old-stm32" folder, the traces and notes were made at SHARD 2019, and reflect a capture done with a CW-Pro on a STM32F target.
2. In the "new-sam4s" folder, the traces were captured with a CW-Husky on a SAM4S target.

These will eventually be moved to a real ChipWhisperer tutorial, but this repo is used to track in-progress work.

Note an attack is also discussed in the 'Hardware Hacking Handbook' too, which is another example you can refer to.
